These are helper scripts for running maintenance and periodic mediawiki jobs.

expanddblist is a PHP script that evaluates a dblist expression or file path and
returns a list of wikis. It is used by mwscript and gets copied to
/usr/local/bin in the php images.

mwscript is an all-script that replaces mwscript, mwscriptwikiset, foreachwiki,
and foreachwikiindblist while maintaining syntax.
It gets copied to /usr/local/bin in the php images, then symlinked as:
 - /usr/local/bin/mwscriptwikiset
 - /usr/local/bin/foreachwiki
 - /usr/local/bin/foreachwikiindblist
Its mode of operation depends on how the script is called:
 - mwscriptwikiset and foreachwikiindblist work the same and will run the given
   maintenance script in a loop for each wiki in the given dblist expression or
   file
 - foreachwiki runs the given maintenance script in a loop for all wikis in
   all.dblist
 - mwscript runs the given maintenance script as is
