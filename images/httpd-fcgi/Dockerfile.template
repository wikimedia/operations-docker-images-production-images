# We define the following environment variables:
# * FCGI_MODE
#   This environment variable can have values
#   - "FCGI_TCP" - default, sends fcgi requests to fcgi://localhost:9000
#   - "FCGI_UNIX" - uses a unix socket instead.
#   Please note you'll have to provide the fcgi daemon yourself.
# * FCGI_URL To be used if you use FCGI_TCP to indicate the url to contact.
# * SERVER_SIGNATURE
#   This is the value of the Server: header. It will probably be overridden for every
#   pod.
# * SERVERGROUP
#   This variable is used already by MediaWiki, and should identify the deployment of the
#   application.
# * LOGFORMAT
#   If set to "ecs", it will make apache output logs in ECS format.
# * LOG_SKIP_SYSTEM
#   If set to 1, it will make logs skip requests for the static endpoints like /metrics or /healthz
# * DEBUG
#   If set to 1, it will enable debug logging
